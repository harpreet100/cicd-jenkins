Steps:

Choose a web application to deploy (it could be a simple "Hello World" application).
Create a Git repository for your application code and a branch for your pipeline configuration.
Choose a CI/CD tool, such as Jenkins or Travis CI, and set up an environment for your pipeline.
Write a pipeline configuration that includes the following stages:
Build: Compile and package the application code into an artifact.
Test: Run automated tests on the application.
Deploy to staging: Deploy the application to a staging environment for further testing.
Deploy to production: Deploy the application to the production environment.
Define infrastructure as code using a tool like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to manage the infrastructure for your staging and production environments.
Configure your pipeline to use the infrastructure as code to provision and configure the staging and production environments.
Add notifications to your pipeline to alert you if any stages fail.
Test your pipeline by making changes to the application code and verifying that the changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production.
